**Norton Amplifier Test Board and Reports**

This repo contains a test board for various configurations of low noise Common Base amplifiers (Starting from the most basic Common Base topology, up to a push-pull Norton design), as well as the accompanying report.

Norton Amplifiers are a form of Common Base amplifiers with transformer feedback from collector to emiter that have good IMD (Specifically IP2) and Noise Figure performance

The designs are based off Dallas Lankford's paper on Norton Amplifiers:

Unfortunately, the current iteration of the PCB will have to be re-spun at some point due to some components missing (AC coupling capacitors after transformers to ground, etc.)
