**Norton Amplifier Test Board and Reports**

This repo contains a test board for various configurations of low noise Common Base amplifiers, as well as the accompanying report.

Norton Amplifiers are a configuration of Common Base amplifiers that have good IMD and Noise Figure performance

The designs are based off Dallas' Lankfords paper:

Unfortunately, the current iteration of the PCB will have to be re-spun at some point due to some components missing (AC coupling capacitors after transformers to ground, etc.)
